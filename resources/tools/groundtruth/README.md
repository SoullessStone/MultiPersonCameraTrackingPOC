# How to run it
Simple:  
* cmake .
* make
* ./Groundtruth Record
* You will now be able to track one player through the whole length of the recording. The application must be run once per player.
* Just order the camera-views in a good way and click at the base of the player you want to track.
* The click will be recorded and the new pictures (500ms later) loaded.
